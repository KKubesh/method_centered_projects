# Method Centered Projects Application

Method Centered Projects is currently in the beginning phase. This application was built to serve the purpose of managing Methods from [The Field Guide for Human Centered Design Methods link](https:www.designkit.org/) by [IDEO.org link](https://www.ideo.org). The application has two primary user roles Admin and User.

⋅⋅* Admin side of the application allows of adding, editing, and removing the method content to the user interface as needed.

⋅⋅* User side of the application allows for the user to add and remove projects. From the projects the user can add and revmoved the methods they will be using on the project.

## The Problem

[The Field Guide for Human Centered Design Methods link](https:www.designkit.org/) has been carried with me for a few years, wearing down the pages and filling it with many post-it notes.

## The Solution

Method Centered Projects Application where the methods from this book can be documented and managed. While allowing for users to manage the methods for each individual project.

## Design & Functionality

The project is meant for designers therefore design had a high priority in the functionality of the project. Please note that the visual side of the project is meant to remain consistently from page to page, while the functionality of each component changed as the admin and user navigated through the application.

Each page is meant to serve as funnel to draw the user in before asking them to commit to creating an account. Once the user logs in functionality is introduced page by page.
